For this short demo, we’re building `catjective: find your kind of cat`. We will be creating two routes, 
incorporating a fetch request to Giphy API, and then rendering the JSON data to the DOM. If you want to skip 
the following steps or clone to follow along, here is the repo. Ironic but in case you don’t want to search 
for an additional cat, the repo also has a cat image you can render for the logo.

**To run the server after creating the server.js and index.html files: go to your terminal and type `node server.js` 
from inside your project folder.**
